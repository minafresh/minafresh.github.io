								<h1> Plant </h1> 
						</CENTER>

					<p><h>A plant is living organism that grows in the earth and has stem, leaves, and roots. When someone plants land with a particular type of plant or crop, they put plants, seeds, or young trees into the land to grow (germinate) them there.</p>
			<p>A living organism of the kind exemplified by trees, shrubs, herbs, grasses, ferns, and mosses, typically growing in a permanent site, absorbing water and inorganic substances through its roots, and synthesizing nutrients in its leaves by photosynthesis using the green pigment chlorophyll. </h2></p>

 			<h1>DIVERSITY OF PLANTS</h1>
 <p>
Plants are multi-cellular and mostly photosynthetic organisms which found essentially everywhere, both in water and on land.
Plant diversity refers to the existence of wide variety of plant species in their natural environments. There are around 300,000-500,000 species of vascular plants that exist on earth.
Land plants includes bryophytes (mosses), lycophytes (ferns), gymnosperms (woody plants without flowers but seeds and cones are present), and angiosperms (flowering plants).
Aquatic plants include varieties of algae. Diversity of plant life is important as it supports various life forms (decomposers and herbivores).</p>

1.	Photosynthesis: the process by which plant utilize light energy for growth. It is part process where the plant captures energy and stores it.
Carbon dioxide + Water --> carbohydrates + oxygen.
2.	Respiration: The process through which stored energy is released so that plant can grow.
3.	Transpiration: the mechanical process within the plant H2O moves through the plant via the xylem, H2O is absorbed by roots hairs and pulled upwards until it is evaporated through the leaf pores.
4.	Translocation: Movement of materials including plants foods and chemical signals within the plant via phloem.
5.	Metabolism: This is the activity within the cells that keeps plants alive and growing.
6.	Temperature: This is plant hardiness, cold hardiness, and heat hardiness.
